Create a professional, scalable, modern web application that transforms Bhutan into a digital‑first nation, connecting citizens, businesses, and government services with gamification, NFTs, e‑governance, and a Bhutan‑backed digital currency — all built exclusively on Avalanche.

🌐 Core Modules & Features
Authentication & Residency Identity

Resident signup/login (email + passwordless wallet).

Residency‑application form.

Mint a Soulbound NFT ID on Avalanche C‑Chain (non‑transferable ERC‑721).

NFT used for auth, KYC status, and residency‑level tracking.

G2B (Government ↔ Business)

Digital business registration flow.

Issue a Business NFT on Avalanche once approved.

Licensing, job‑posting, and application‑tracking dashboards.

Gamified Residency System

Task engine (cultural quizzes, contributions, learning modules).

Earn Brownie Points (on‑chain ERC‑20) → tiered benefits.

Tier logic stored in a smart contract so benefits are provably enforced.

G2C / B2C Job Portal

Post/apply for jobs, attach résumés, track status.

Payments and deposits handled with the platform token (see below).

Digital Marketplace + Mini‑App Store

Residents list Bhutanese goods/services.

Telegram‑style Mini‑Apps run in sandbox iframes—each Mini‑App can sign Avalanche transactions via injected provider.

Platform charges small, on‑chain fee to a government treasury wallet.

Digital Bhutan Currency

Launch “NuBuck” (working title) as an Avalanche Subnet token backed by Bhutan’s Bitcoin reserve.

Native currency for every transaction: marketplace, taxes, salaries, fees.

Built‑in wallet (Core Wallet & MetaMask on Avalanche) with fiat gateway module (optional).

🎨 Cultural Design Integration
Palette inspired by the Bhutanese flag (orange #f48c28, yellow #fecd2f, white accents).

UI components feature subtle dzong‑roof motifs and traditional patterns.

Hero sections showcase SVG/artwork of Paro Taktsang or Punakha Dzong.

“Cultural Mode” toggle for extra heritage flourishes (animated prayer‑wheel loader, etc.).

🛠️ Tech Stack (Avalanche‑first)
Layer	Tech Choices	Notes
Frontend	Next.js + React, Tailwind CSS	SPA with SSR for SEO; connect via ethers.js or avalanche.js.
Smart Contracts	Solidity (EVM) on Avalanche C‑Chain for NFTs, Brownie Points, governance; Avalanche Subnet token for NuBuck	Use Hardhat + Foundry tests, contract upgrades via OpenZeppelin Upgradeable proxies.
Backend API	Node.js (Fastify) or Python/Django	Reads blockchain via Avalanche RPC; queues off‑chain tasks (IPFS pinning, emails).
Database	PostgreSQL	Stores non‑sensitive off‑chain data & indexes.
Storage	IPFS / Arweave for media & metadata	NFT JSON + images.
Wallets	Core Wallet, MetaMask (Avalanche network), WalletConnect	Deep‑link and QR flows for mobile.

🚀 Deliverables
Complete monorepo (frontend, backend, contracts).

Deployed smart contracts on Avalanche Fuji testnet + scripts for mainnet/Subnet migration.

Working admin panel.

Sample Mini‑App in the store (e.g., “Learn Dzongkha” quiz).

Comprehensive docs + architecture diagram.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
100 % of on‑chain logic lives on Avalanche (C‑Chain + custom Subnet).

End‑to‑end test suite (Jest / Playwright + Hardhat/Foundry).

Responsive design passes Lighthouse > 90.

Code maintainable, with clear module boundaries for future Bhutan‑government teams.
